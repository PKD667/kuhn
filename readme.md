# Kuhn's computer program

A modest attempt a recreating Kuhn's program from *Second Thoughts on Paradigms*. My approach is to recreate an evolutionary algorithm recreating Kuhn's vision of stimulus intepretation. The program tries to follow as closely as possible the description given by Kuhn in his book.
